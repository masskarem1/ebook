  "2": "Preface\n\nTeaching introductory algebra-based physics can be a most\nchallenging—and rewarding—experience. Students enter\nthe course with a wide range of backgrounds, interests, and\nskills and we strive not only to convey the basic concepts\nand fundamental laws of physics but also to give students\nan appreciation of its relevance and appeal. This book to\nhelp with that task. It incorporates a number of unique and\ninnovative pedagogical features that evolved from years of\nteaching experience.\n\nA key goal of this text is to help students make the\nconnection between a conceptual understanding of physics\nand the various skills necessary to solve quantitative\nproblems. One of the chief means to that end is the\nreplacement of traditional “textbook” Examples with an\nintegrated system of learning tools: fully worked Examples\nwith Solutions, Active Examples, Conceptual Checkpoints,\nand Exercises. Each of these tools is specialized to meet the\nneeds of students at a particular point in the development of\na chapter.\n\nThese needs are not always the same. Sometimes students\nrequire a detailed explanation of how to tackle a particular\nproblem; at other times, they must be allowed to take an\nactive role and work out the details for themselves.\nSometimes it is important for them to perform calculations\nand concentrate on numerical precision; at other times it is\nmore fruitful for them to explore a key idea in a conceptual\n",

And sometimes, all that is required is practice\nusing a new equation or definition.\n\nThis text attempts to emulate the teaching style of\nsuccessful instructors by providing the right tool at the right\nplace and the right time.\n\nSince physics applies to everything in nature, it is only\nreasonable to point out applications of physics that students\nmay encounter in the real world. Each chapter presents a\nnumber of discussions focusing on “Real-World Physics.”.\nApplications that pertain more specifically to biology and\nmedicine are introduced.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to express sincere gratitude to our\ncolleagues at Misr University for Science and Technology\nfor their contributions to this book. We owe a great debt to\nall our students over the years. Our interactions with them\nprovided the motivation and inspiration that led to this\nbook.\n",

Flowing gases cause pressure differences that\ncan lift a massive cargo plane or the roof off a house in a hurricane.\nThe study of any one of these states of matter is itself a vast\ndiscipline.

Often this classification system is\nextended to include a fourth state of matter, called plasma.\nAll matter consists of some distribution of atoms or\nmolecules. The atoms in a solid, held together by forces that\nare mainly electrical, are located at specific positions with\nrespect to one another and vibrate about those positions. At\nlow temperatures, the vibrating motion is slight and the\natoms can be considered essentially fixed. As energy is added\nto the material, the amplitude of the vibrations increases. A\nvibrating atom can be viewed as being bound in its\nequilibrium position by springs attached to neighboring\natoms. A collection of such atoms and imaginary springs is\nshown in Figure 2.1. We can picture applied external forces\nas compressing these tiny internal springs. When the external\nforces are removed, the solid tends to return to its original\nshape and size. Consequently, a solid is said to have\nelasticity.\n\nFigure 2.1 A model of a portion of a solid. The\natoms (spheres) are imagined as being attached\nto each other by springs, which represent the\nelastic nature of the interatomic forces.

In an amorphous solid, such as glass,\nthe atoms are arranged almost randomly, as in Figure 2.2b.\nFor any given substance, the liquid state exists at a higher\ntemperature than the solid state. The intermolecular forces in\na liquid aren’t strong enough to keep the molecules in fixed\npositions, and they wander through the liquid in random\nfashion (Fig. 2.2c).

THE DEFORMATION OF SOLIDS\n\nWhile a solid may be thought of as having a definite shape\nand volume, it’s possible to change its shape and volume by\napplying external forces. A sufficiently large force will\npermanently deform or break an object, but otherwise, when\nthe external forces are removed, the object tends to return to\nits original shape and size. This is called elastic behavior.\nThe elastic properties of solids are discussed in terms of\nstress and strain. Stress is the force per unit area causing a\ndeformation; strain is a measure of the amount of the\ndeformation. For sufficiently small stresses, stress is\nproportional to strain, with the constant of proportionality\ndepending on the material being deformed and on the nature\nof the deformation. We call this proportionality constant the\nelastic modulus:\n\nstress = elastic modulus x strain (2.1)\n\nThe elastic modulus is analogous to a spring constant. It can\nbe taken as the stiffness of a material: A material having a\nlarge elastic modulus is very stiff and difficult to deform.\nThere are three relationships having the form of Equation\n(2.1), corresponding to tensile, shear, and bulk deformation,\nand all of them satisfy an equation similar to Hooke’s law for\nsprings:\n\n44\n",

In fact, the force constant\ndecreases.\n\nThe reason for the reduced force constant is that if we apply a force F\nto the compound spring, each individual spring stretches by a certain\namount. The compound spring, then, stretches by twice this amount. By\nHooke’s law, F = kAL, a spring that stretches twice as far for the same\napplied force has half the force constant. We can also obtain this result\nby recalling that the force constant is k = YA/Lo.

ARCHIMEDES’ PRINCIPLE AND BUOYANCY\n\nThe fact that a fluid’s pressure increases with depth leads to\nmany interesting consequences. Among them is the fact that\na fluid exerts a net upward force on any object it surrounds.\nThis is referred to as a buoyant force.\n\nTo see the origin of buoyancy, consider a cubical block\nimmersed in a fluid of density p as in Figure 3-5. The\nsurrounding fluid exerts normal forces on all of its faces.\nClearly, the horizontal forces pushing to the right and to the\nleft are equal; hence they cancel and have no effect on the\nblock.\n\nThe situation is quite different for the vertical forces,\nhowever. Note, for example, that the downward force exerted\n\n82\n",

A fluid\n\nsurrounding an object exerts a buoyant force in\n\nthe upward direction. This is due to the fact that\n\npressure increases with depth, and hence the\n\nupward force on the object, F2, is greater than the\n| downward force, F1.\n\nLet’s calculate the buoyant force acting on the block. First,\nwe assume that the cubical block is of length LZ on a side, and\nthat the pressure on the top surface is P;. The downward\nforce on the block, then, is\n\nF.=P,A=PL’\n\nNote that we have used the fact that the area of a square face\nof side L is L?. Next, we consider the bottom face.

Therefore, the buoyant\nforce is equal to the weight of fluid that is displaced by the\ncube. This is a special case of Archimedes’ principle:\n\nAn object completely immersed in a fluid experiences an\nupward buoyant force equal in magnitude to the weight of\nfluid displaced by the object.\n\nMore generally, if a volume V of an object is immersed in a\nfluid of density a; the buoyant force can be expressed as\nfollows:\n\nF, = p.g¥ (3.7)\n\nThe volume V may be the total volume of the object, or any\nfraction of the total volume.

This is the reason small\ndrops of dew are always spherical. Larger drops of water\nmay be distorted by the downward pull of Earth’s gravity,\nbut in orbit drops of all sizes are spherical.\n\nSince energy is required to increase the area of a liquid\nsurface, the situation is similar to the energy required to\nstretch a spring or to stretch a sheet of rubber.

Similarly, when an insect alights on\nthe surface of a pond, it creates dimples that increase the\nsurface area. The water resists this distortion with a force\nsufficient to support the weight of the insect—if the insect is\nnot too large. In fact, even a needle or a razor blade can be\nsupported on the surface of water if they are put into place\ngently, even though they have densities significantly greater\nthan the density of water.\n\nBreathing, alveoli, and premature birth\n\nSurface tension, which is important in many biological\nsystems, plays a particularly important role in human\nbreathing. For example, the crucial exchange of oxygen and\ncarbon dioxide between inspired air and the blood occurs\nacross the membranes of small balloonlike structures called\nalveoli. During inhalation, the alveoli expand from a radius\nof about 0.050 mm to 0.10 mm as they draw in fresh air. The\nwalls of the alveoli are coated with a thin film of water,\nhowever, and in order to expand they must push outward\nagainst the water’s surface tension— like trying to inflate a\nballoon against the surface tension of the rubber. To reduce\nthe rather large surface tension of water, and make breathing\neasier, the lungs produce a substance called a surfactant that\nmixes with the water. This surfactant is produced rather late\nin the development of a fetus, however, and therefore\npremature infants may experience respiratory distress and\neven death as a result of too much surface tension in their\nalveoli.\n\n129\n",

These basic notions about\ntemperature carry over into physics, though with a bit more\nprecision.\n\nSimilarly, when we put a cool pan of water on a hot stove\nburner we say that “heat” flows from the hot burner to the\ncool water. To be more precise, as required in physics, we\nwill define heat as follows:\n\nHeat is the energy that is transferred between\nobjects because of a temperature difference.\n\nTherefore, when we say that there is a “transfer of heat” or a\n“heat flow” from object A to object B, we simply mean that\nthe total energy of object A decreases and the total energy of\nobject B increases.

In general, when a hot object is brought\ninto thermal contact with a cold object, heat will be\nexchanged. The result is that the hot object cools off—and its\nmolecules move more slowly—while the cold object warms\nup—and its molecules move more rapidly. After some time\nin thermal contact, the transfer of heat ceases. At this point,\nwe say that the objects are in thermal equilibrium. The study\nof physical processes involving the transfer of heat is the area\nof physics referred to as thermodynamics. Because\nthermodynamics deals with the flow of energy within and\nbetween objects, it has great practical importance in all areas\nof the life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering.\n\nNote that thermal contact and physical contact are not\nnecessarily the same. For example, thermal contact can occur\neven when there is no physical contact at all—as when you\nwarm your hands near a fire.\n\nZeroth Law of Thermodynamics\n\nWe now introduce perhaps the most fundamental law obeyed\nby thermodynamic systems—referred to, appropriately\nenough, as the zeroth law of thermodynamics. The zeroth law\nspells out the basic properties of temperature. Its name\nreflects not only its basic importance, but also its subtlety, in\nthat it was not recognized as a separate law until after the\nother three laws of thermodynamics had been accepted.\nLater, we introduce the remaining three laws of\n\n137\n",

These laws enable us to analyze the\nbehavior of engines and refrigerators, and to show, among\nother things, that perpetual motion machines are not possible.\n\nThe basic idea of the zeroth law of thermodynamics is that\nthermal equilibrium is determined by a single physical\nquantity—the temperature. For example, two objects in\nthermal contact are in equilibrium when they have the same\ntemperature. If one or the other has a higher temperature,\nheat flows from that object to the other until their\ntemperatures are equal.\n\nThis may seem almost too obvious to mention, at least until\nyou give it more thought.

We begin with objects A\nand B in thermal contact and in equilibrium. Next, object B is\nseparated from A, and placed in contact with C. Objects C\nand B are also found to be in equilibrium. Hence, by the\nzeroth law, we are assured that when A and C are placed in\ncontact they also will be in equilibrium.\n\nTo apply this principle to our example, let object Abe the\npiece of metal and object C be the pool of water. Object B,\nthen, can be a thermometer, used to mea- sure the\ntemperature of the metal and the water.

TEMPERATURE SCALES\n\nA variety of temperature scales are commonly used both in\neveryday situations and in physics. Some are related to\nfamiliar reference points, such as the temperature of boiling\nor freezing water. Others have more complex, historical\nrationales for their values. Here we consider three of the\nmore frequently used temperature scales. We also examine\nthe connections between them.\n\n139\n",
  "139": "CHAPTER4 Thermal Physics\n\nLater in this chapter we will discuss some of the physical\nphenomena—such as thermal expansion—that can be used to\nconstruct a thermometer. With a properly calibrated\nthermometer, we can determine the temperature on any of\nthese scales. In the next chapter, we will explore more fully\nthe question of just what temperature means on a conceptual\nand microscopic level.\n\nThe Celsius Scale\n\nPerhaps the easiest temperature scale to remember is the\nCelsius scale, named in honor of the Swedish astronomer\nAnders Celsius (1701-1744). Originally, Celsius assigned\nzero degrees to boiling water and 100 degrees to freezing\nwater. These values were later reversed by the biologist\nCarolus Linnaeus (1707-1778). Thus, today we say that\nwater freezes at zero degrees Celsius, which we abbreviate as\n0 °C, and boils at 100 °C.\n\nNote that the choice of zero level for a temperature scale is\nquite arbitrary, as is the number of degrees between any two\nreference points. In the Celsius scale, as in others, there is no\nupper limit to the value a temperature may have. There is a\nlower limit, however. For the Celsius scale, the lowest\npossible temperature is -273.15 °C as we shall see later in\nthis section.\n\nOne bit of notation should be pointed out before we continue.\nWhen we write a Celsius temperature, we give a numerical\nvalue followed by the degree symbol, °, and the capital letter\nC. For example, 5 °C is the temperature five degrees Celsius.\nOn the other hand, if the temperature of an object is changed\n\n140\n",
  "140": "Temperature Scales\n\nby a given amount, we use the notation C°. Thus, if we\nincrease the temperature by five degrees on the Celsius scale,\nwe say that the change in temperature is 5 C°; that is, five\nCelsius degrees. This is summarized below:\n\nA temperature T of five degrees is 5 °C (five degrees Celsius)\n\nA temperature change of five degrees 1s 5 C° (five Celsius degrees)\nThe Fahrenheit Scale\n\nThe Fahrenheit scale was developed by Gabriel Fahrenheit\n(1686-1736), who chose zero to be the lowest temperature he\nwas able to achieve in his laboratory. He also chose 96\ndegrees to be body temperature, though why he made this\nchoice is not known. In the modern version of the Fahrenheit\nscale body temperature is 98.6 °F; in addition, water freezes\nat 32 °F and boils at 212 °F. Lastly, using the same\nconvention as for °C and C°, we say that an increase of 180\nF° is required to bring water from freezing to boiling.\n\nNote that the Fahrenheit scale not only has a different zero\nthan the Celsius scale, it also has a different “size” for its\ndegree. As just noted, 180 Fahrenheit degrees are required\nfor the same change in temperature as 100 Celsius degrees.\nHence, the Fahrenheit degrees are smaller by a factor of\n100/180=5/9.\n\nTo convert between a Fahrenheit temperature, and a Celsius\ntemperature, T., we start by writing a linear relation between\nthem.

As the name suggests, a\nbimetallic strip consists of two metals bonded together to\nform a linear strip of metal. This is illustrated in Figure 4—S.\nSince two different metals will, in general, have different\ncoefficients of linear expansion, a, the two sides of the strip\nwill change lengths by different amounts when heated or\ncooled.\n\nIf B has a greater coefficient\nof linear expansion than A...\n\nElectrical\n\n(a) A bimetallic strip .. then it shrinks more - and expands\na— contact Electrical\n\n<2 when cooled ... more when heated.\nl } contact\n\n(b) Chilling the strip (c) Heating the strip (d) A bimetallic strip in a thermostat\nA FIGURE 4-5 Abimetallic strip\n\n(a) A bimetallic strip composed of metals A and B. (b) If metal B has a larger coefficient of linear expansion than metal A, it will shrink\nmore when cooled and (c) expand more when heated. (d) A bimetallic strip can be used to construct a thermostat. If the temperature\nfalls, the strip bends downward and closes the electric circuit, which then operates a heater. When the temperature rises, the strip\ndeflects in the opposite direction, breaking the circuit and turning off the heater.\n\nFor example, suppose metal B in Figure 4—5 (a) has the\nlarger coefficient of linear expansion. This means that its\nlength will change by greater amounts than metal A for the\nsame temperature change. Hence, if this strip is cooled, the B\nside will shrink more than the A side, resulting in the strip\nbending toward the B side, as in Figure 4—5 (b). On the other\n\n153\n",
  "153": "CHAPTER4 Thermal Physics\n\nhand, if the strip is heated, the B side expands by a greater\namount than the A side, and the strip curves toward the A\nside, as in Figure 4—5 (c). Thus, the shape of the bimetallic\nstrip depends sensitively on temperature.\n\nBecause of this property, bimetallic strips are used in a\nvariety of thermal applications. For example, a bimetallic\nstrip can be used as a thermometer; as the strip changes its\nshape it can move a needle to indicate the temperature.\nSimilarly, many thermostats have a bimetallic strip to turn on\nor shut off a heater. This is shown in Figure 4—5 (d). As the\ntemperature of the room changes, the bimetallic strip deflects\nin one direction or the other, which either closes or breaks\nthe electric circuit connected to the heater.\n\nAnother common use of thermal expansion is_ the\nantiscalding device for water faucets. An antiscalding device\nis simply a valve inside a water faucet that is attached to a\nspring. When the water temperature is at a safe level, the\nvalve permits water to flow freely through the faucet. If the\ntemperature of the water reaches a dangerous level, however,\nthe thermal expansion of the spring is enough to close the\nvalve and stop the flow of water—thus preventing\ninadvertent scalding. When the water cools down again, the\nvalve reopens and the flow of water resumes.\n\nFinally, thermal expansion can have undesirable effects in\nsome cases. For example, you may have noticed that bridges\noften have gaps between different sections of the structure.\nWhen the air temperature rises in the summer, the sections of\nthe bridge can expand freely into these gaps. If the gaps were\nnot present, the expansion of the different sections could\n\n154\n",

Expansion joints can also be\nfound in railroad tracks and oil pipelines, to name just two\nother examples.\n\nA The Eiffel Tower in Paris gains about\na thirteenth of an inch in height for each\nFahrenheit degree that the temperature rises.\n\nArea Expansion\n\nSince the length of an object changes with temperature, it\nfollows that its area changes as well. To see precisely how\nthe area changes, consider a square piece of metal of length L\non a side. The initial area of the square is A=L7. If the\ntemperature of the square is increased by AT; the length of\neach side increases from L to L + AL =L + aLAT.

For example, in the last chapter we\ndiscussed the fact that the solid form of water (ice) is less\ndense than the liquid form. Hence, icebergs float. What is\nremarkable about icebergs floating is not that 90% is\nsubmerged, but that 10%, or any amount at all, is above the\nwater. The solids of most substances are denser than their\nliquids; hence when they freeze, their solids immediately\nsink.\n\nHere we consider the unusual thermal behavior of water.\nFigure 4—7 shows the density of water over a wide range of\ntemperatures. Note that the density is a maximum at about 4\n°C. Thus, when you heat water from 0 °C to 4 °C it actually\nshrinks, rather than expands, and becomes more dense. The\nreason is that water molecules that were once part of the\n\n161\n",

When temperatures drop in the\nwinter, the surface waters of a lake cool first and sink,\nallowing warmer water to rise to the surface to be cooled in\nturn. Eventually, a lake can fill with water at 4 °C. Further\ndrops in temperature result in cooler, less dense water near\nthe surface, where it floats until it freezes. Thus, lakes freeze\non the top surface first, with the bottom water staying\nrelatively warm at about 4 °C. In addition, the ice and snow\non top of a lake act as thermal insulation, slowing the\ncontinued growth of ice.\n\nOn the other hand, if water had more ordinary behavior—like\nshrinking when cooled, and a solid form that is more dense\nthan the liquid—a lake would freeze from the bottom up.\nThere would be no insulating layer of ice on top, and if the\nwinter were long enough, and cold enough, the lake could\n\n162\n",

This, of course, would be disastrous for fish and\nother creatures that live in the water.\n\nFinally, the same physics that is responsible for floating\nicebergs and ice-capped lakes is to blame for water pipes that\nburst in the winter. Even a water pipe made of steel is not\nstrong enough to keep from rupturing when the ice forming\nwithin it expands outward.

HEAT AND MECHANICAL WORK\n\nIn this section we consider the connection between heat and\nmechanical work. We also discuss the conservation of energy\nas it regards heat.\n\nAs mentioned previously, heat is the energy transferred from\none object to another. At one time it was thought—\nerroneously—that an object contained a certain amount of\n“heat fluid,” or caloric, that could flow from one place to\nanother. This idea was overturned by the observations of\nBenjamin Thompson (1753-1814), also known as Count\nRumford, the American-born physicist, spy, and social\nreformer who at one point in his eclectic career supervised\nthe boring of cannon barrels by large drills. He observed that\nas long as mechanical work was done to turn the drill bits,\nthey continued to produce heat in unlimited quantities.\nClearly, the unlimited heat observed in boring the cannons\nwas not present initially in the metal, but instead was\nproduced by continually turning the drill bit.\n\n164\n",
  "164": "Heat and Mechanical Work\n\nWith this observation, it became clear that heat was simply\nanother form of energy that must be taken into account when\napplying conservation of energy. For example, if you rub\nsandpaper back and forth over a piece of wood, you do work.\nThe energy associated with that work is not lost; instead, it\nproduces an increase in temperature. Taking into account the\nenergy associated with this temperature change, we find that\nenergy is indeed conserved. In fact, no observation has ever\nindicated a situation in which energy is not conserved.\n\nThe equivalence between\nwork and heat was first\nexplored quantitatively by\nJames Prescott Joule (1818—\n1889), the British physicist.\nIn one of his experiments,\nJoule observed the increase\nin temperature in a device\n\nsimilar to that shown in | .\nFigure 4-8.

With his experiments,\nJoule was able to show that 1 kcal or equivalently, that one\ncalorie of heat transfer is the equivalent of 4.186 J of\nmechanical work. This is referred to as the mechanical\nequivalent of heat:\n\n1 cal = 4.186 J (4-8)\n\nIn studies of nutrition a different calorie is used.

We\nhave to be clear about the fact that we are heating water,\nhowever, because the heat required for a 1 C° increase varies\nconsiderably from one substance to another.

The Sun, for\nexample, warms the Earth from across 93 million miles of\nempty space by a process known as radiation. As the sunlight\nstrikes the ground and raises its temperature, the ground-\nlevel air gets warmer and begins to rise, producing a further\nexchange of heat by means of convection. Finally, if you\nwalk across the ground in bare feet, you will feel the\nwarming effect of heat entering your body by conduction. In\nthis section we consider each of these three mechanisms of\nheat exchange in detail.\n\nConduction\n\nPerhaps the most familiar form of heat exchange is\nconduction, which is the flow of heat directly through a\nphysical material. For example, if you hold one end of a\nmetal rod and put the other end in a fire, it doesn’t take long\nbefore you begin to feel warmth on your end. The heat you\nfeel is transported along the rod by conduction.\n\nLet’s consider this observation from a microscopic point of\nview. To begin, when you placed one end of the rod into the\n\n182\n",
  "182": "Conduction, Convection, and Radiation\n\nfire, the high temperature at that location caused the\nmolecules to vibrate with an increased amplitude. These\nmolecules in turn jostle their neighbors and cause them to\nvibrate with greater amplitude as well. Eventually, the effect\ntravels from molecule to molecule across the length of the\nrod, resulting in the macroscopic phenomenon of conduction.\n\nIf you were to repeat the experiment, this time with a wooden\nrod, the hot end of the rod would heat up so much that it\nmight even catch on fire, but your end would still be\ncomfortably cool. Thus, conduction depends on the type of\nmaterial involved. Some materials, called conductors,\nconduct heat very well, whereas other materials, called\ninsulators, conduct heat poorly.\n\nJust how much heat flows as a result of conduction?

As with the room heater, the warm portions of the\nfluid rise because of their lower density and the cool portions\nsink because of their higher density. Thus, in convection,\ntemperature differences result in a flow of fluid. It is this\nphysical flow of matter that carries heat throughout the\nsystem.\n\nConvection occurs on an enormous range of length scales.\nFor example, the same type of uneven heating produced by\nan electric heater in a room can occur in the atmosphere of\nthe Earth as well. The common seashore occurrence of sea\nbreezes during the day and land breezes in the evening is one\nsuch example. (See Figure 4—11for an illustration of this\neffect.)\n\n192\n",

This is\nbecause the land, which is mostly rocks, has a lower specific heat than the water.\nThe warm land heats the air above it, which becomes less dense and rises. Cooler\nair from over the water flows in to take its place, producing a “sea breeze.” (b) At\nnight, the land cools off more rapidly than the water—again because of its lower\nspecific heat. Now it is the air above the relatively warm water that rises and is\nreplaced by cooler air from over the land, producing a “land breeze.”\n\nOn a larger scale, the Sun causes greater warming near the\nequator than near the poles; as a result, warm equatorial air\nrises, cool polar air descends, and global convection patterns\nare established. Similar convection patterns occur in ocean\nwaters, and plate tectonics is believed to be caused, at least in\npart, by convection currents in the Earth’s mantle. The Sun\nalso has convection currents, due to the intense heating that\noccurs in its interior, and disturbances in these currents are\noften visible as sunspots.\n\n193\n",
  "193": "CHAPTER4 Thermal Physics\n\n» When you light a candle, it heats the air near the flame as it burns. Because hot air is less\ndense—and hence more buoyant—than cool air, a circulation pattern is established with hot air\nrising and being replaced from below by cool, oxygenated air. Thus, convection is necessary for\na candle to continue burning. When the burning candle in this jar is dropped, it suddenly finds\nitself in free fall—an essentially “weightless” environment where buoyancy has no effect. As a\nresult, convection ceases and the flame is quickly extinguished as it consumes all the oxygen in\nits immediate vicinity.\n\nRadiation\n\nThough convection and conduction occur primarily in\nspecific situations, all objects give off energy as a result of\nradiation. The energy radiated by an object is in the form of\nelectromagnetic waves, which include visible light as well as\ninfrared and ultraviolet radiation. Thus, unlike convection\nand conduction, radiation has no need for a physical material\nto mediate the energy transfer, since electromagnetic waves\ncan propagate through empty space—that is, through a\nvacuum. Therefore, the heat you feel radiated from a hot\nfurnace would reach you even if the air were suddenly\n\n194\n",

This is the physical basis\nof the optical pyrometer, invented by Josiah Wedgwood\n(1730-1795), the renowned English potter. When objects are\nabout 800 °C they appear to be a dull “red hot.” Examples\ninclude the heating coils in a range or oven. The filament in\nan incandescent light bulb glows “yellow hot” at about 3000\n°C, about the same temperature as the surface of the red\nsupergiant star Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion. The\nsurface of the Sun, in comparison, is about 6000 °C. Very hot\nstars, with surface temperatures in the vicinity of 10,000 to\n30,000 °C, are “blue hot” and actually appear bluish in the\nnight sky. Rigel, also in the constellation Orion, is an\nexample of such a star.

Even when it cools enough to\nstop glowing, it still emits energy, but most of it is in the\nform of invisible infrared radiation.\n\nThe energy radiated per time by an object—that is, the\nradiated power, P—is proportional to the surface area, A,\nover which the radiation occurs. It also depends on the\ntemperature of the object. In fact, the dependence is on the\nfourth power of the temperature, 7’ where T is the Kelvin-\nscale temperature.

The\ninternal energy stored in humans goes into other forms\nneeded for maintaining and repairing the major body organs\nand is transferred out of the body by work as a person walks\nor lifts a heavy object, and by heat when the body is warmer\nthan its surroundings.

Because all animals are actually open systems, they\nacquire internal energy (chemical potential energy) by eating\nand breathing, so their internal energy and temperature are\nkept constant. Overall, the energy from the oxidation of food\nultimately supplies the work done by the body and energy\nlost from the body by heat, and this is the interpretation we\ngive Equation 4-21.

To be specific, suppose we tie a rope\nfrom the seat of the first swing to its neighbor, and then another\nrope from the second swing to the third swing, and so on.\nWhen the swings are at rest—in equilibrtum— the connecting\nropes have no effect. If you now sit in the first swing and begin\noscillating—thus “disturbing” the equilibrium—the\nconnecting ropes cause the other swings along the line to start\noscillating as well. You have created a traveling disturbance.\n\nIn general, a disturbance that propagates from one place to\nanother is referred to as a wave. Waves propagate with well-\ndefined speeds determined by the properties of the material\nthrough which they travel. In addition, waves carry energy.\nFor example, part of the energy you put into sound waves\nwhen you speak is carried to the ears of others, where some of\nthe sound energy is converted into electrical energy carried by\nnerve impulses to the brain which, in turn, creates the\nsensation of hearing.\n\n218\n",

  "227": "CHAPTER 5 Waves and Sound\n\nThe Speed of a Wave on a String\n\nThe speed of a wave is determined by the properties of the\nmedium through which it propagates. In the case of a string of\nlength L, there are two basic characteristics that determine the\nspeed of a wave: (i) the tension in the string, and (11) the mass\nof the string.\n\nLet’s begin with the tension, which is the force F transmitted\nthrough the string (we will use F for the tension rather than T,\nto avoid confusion between the tension and the period).\nClearly, there must be a tension in a string in order for it to\npropagate a wave. Imagine, for example, that a string lies on a\nsmooth floor with both ends free. If you take one end into your\nhand and shake it, the portions of the string near your hand\nwill oscillate slightly, but no wave will travel to the other end\nof the string. If someone else takes hold of the other end of the\nstring and pulls enough to set up a tension, then any movement\nyou make on your end will propagate to the other end. In fact,\nif the tension is increased—so that the string becomes less\nslack—waves will travel through the string more rapidly.\n\nNext, we consider the mass m of the string. A heavy string\nresponds slowly to a given disturbance because of its inertia.\nThus, if you try sending a wave through a kite string or a large\nrope, both under the same tension, you will find that the wave\nin the rope travels more slowly. In general, the heavier a rope\nor string the slower the speed of waves in it. Of course, the\ntotal mass of a string doesn’t really matter; a longer string has\n\n228\n",

  "232": "Waves on a String\n\nThe speed of the wave is determined by the\n\ntension in the rope and its mass per length. The\nmass per length is the same from bottom to top,\nbut not the tension. In particular, the tension at any\npoint in the rope is equal to the weight of rope\nbelow that point. Thus, the tension increases from\nalmost zero near the bottom to essentially Mg near\nthe top. Since the tension increases with height, so\ntoo does the speed, according to Equation 5-2.\n\nANSWER\n\n(a) The speed increases.\nReflections\n\nThus far we have discussed only the situation in which a wave\ntravels along a string; but at some point the wave must reach\nthe end of the string. What happens then? Clearly, we expect\nthe wave to be reflected, but the precise way in which the\nreflection occurs needs to be considered.\n\nSuppose, for example, that the far end of a string is anchored\nfirmly into a wall, as shown in Figure 5—7. If you give a flick\nto your end of the string, you set up a wave “pulse” that travels\ntoward the far end. When it reaches the end, it exerts an\nupward force on the wall, trying to pull it up into the pulse.\nSince the end is tied down, however, the wall exerts an equal\nand opposite downward force to keep the end at rest. Thus, the\nwall exerts a downward force on the string that is just the\nopposite of the upward force you exerted when you created the\n\n233\n",

In this case, the string is tied to a small ring that slides\nvertically with little friction on a vertical pole. In this way, the\nstring still has a tension in it, since it pulls on the ring, but it is\nalso free to move up and down.\n\n234\n",
  "234": "Harmonic Wave Functions\n\nConsider a pulse moving along such a string, as in Figure 5—\n8. When the pulse reaches the end, it lifts the ring upward and\nthen lowers it back down. In fact, the pulse flicks the far end\nof the string in the same way that you flicked it when you\ncreated the pulse. Therefore, the far end of the string simply\ncreates a new pulse, identical to the first, only traveling in the\nopposite direction. This is illustrated in the figure.\n\nThus, when waves reflect, they may or may not be inverted,\ndepending on how the reflection occurs.\n\n3. HARMONIC WAVE FUNCTIONS\n\nIf a wave is generated by oscillating one end of a string with\nsimple harmonic motion, the waves will have the shape of a\nsine or a cosine.

In air, under normal atmospheric pressure and\ntemperature, the speed of sound is approximately the\nfollowing:\n\nSpeed of sound at room temperature, 20 °C\nv =343m/s=720mi/h\nSI unit: m/s\n\nWhen we refer to the speed of sound in this text we will always\nassume the value is 343 m/s, unless stated specifically\notherwise.\n\nThe speed of sound in air is directly related to the speed of the\nmolecules themselves. Did you know, for example, that the air\nmolecules colliding with your body at this moment have\nspeeds that are essentially the speed of sound? As the air is\nheated the molecules will move faster, and hence the speed of\nsound also increases with temperature.\n\nIn a solid, the speed of sound is determined in part by how stiff\nthe material is. The stiffer the material, the faster the sound\nwave, just as having more tension in a string causes a faster\nwave. Thus the speed of sound in plastic is rather high (2680\nm/s), and in steel it is greater still (5960 m/s). Both speeds are\nmuch higher than the speed in air, which is certainly a\n“squishy” material in comparison. Table 5—1 gives a sampling\nof sound speed in a range of different materials.\n\n241\n",

This\ngives rise to the following popular rule of thumb: The distance to a\nlightning strike (in miles) is the time for the thunder to arrive (in seconds)\ndivided by 5. Notice that we have neglected the travel time of light in our\ndiscussion. This is because light propagates with such a high speed\n(approximately 186,000 mi/s) that its travel time is about a million times\nless than that of sound.\n\nANSWER\n\n(a) The lightning was about a mile away.\n\n[D.C BOR, WISHING WELL\n\nYou drop a stone from rest into a well that is 7.35 m deep.\nHow long does it take before you hear the splash?\n\nSOLUTION\n\n243\n",

Similarly, as you hum a song\nyou change the shape and size of your vocal chords slightly to\nchange the frequency of the sound you produce.\n\nThe frequency range of human hearing extends well beyond\nthe range of a piano, however. As a rule of thumb, humans can\nhear sounds between 20 Hz on the low-frequency end and\n20,000 Hz on the high-frequency end. Sounds with\nfrequencies above this range are referred to as ultrasonic,\nwhile those with frequencies lower than 20 Hz are classified\nas infrasonic. Though we are unable to hear ultrasound and\ninfrasound, these frequencies occur commonly in nature, and\nare used in many technological applications as well.\n\nFor example, bats and dolphins produce ultrasound almost\ncontinuously as they go about their daily lives. By listening to\nthe echoes of their calls—that is, by using echolocation—they\nare able to navigate about their environment and detect their\nprey. As a defense mechanism, some of the insects that are\npreyed upon by bats have the ability to hear the ultrasonic\n\n245\n",

For\ninstance, the praying mantis has a specialized ultrasound\nreceptor on its abdomen that allows it to take cover in response\nto an approaching bat. More dramatically, certain moths fold\ntheir wings in flight and drop into a precipitous dive toward\nthe ground when they hear a bat on the prowl.\n\nMedical applications of ultrasound are also common. Perhaps\nthe most familiar is the ultrasound scan that is used to image a\nfetus in the womb. By sending bursts of ultrasound into the\nbody and measuring the time delay of the resulting echoes—\nthe technological equivalent of echolocation—tt is possible to\nmap out the location of structures that lie hidden beneath the\nskin. In addition to imaging the interior of a body, ultrasound\ncan also produce changes within the body that would\notherwise require surgery. For example, in a technique called\nshock wave lithotripsy (SWL), an intense beam of ultrasound\nis concentrated onto a kidney stone that must be removed.\nAfter being hit with as many as 1000 to 3000 pulses of sound\n(at 23 joules per pulse), the stone is fractured into small pieces\nthat the body can then eliminate on its own.\n\nAs for infrasound, it has been discovered in recent years that\nelephants can communicate with one another using sounds\nwith frequencies as low as 15 Hz. In fact, it may be that most\nelephant communication is infrasonic. These sounds, which\nhumans feel as vibration rather than hear as sound, can carry\nover an area of about thirty square kilometers on the dry\n\n246\n",

Ultrasound\nscans, or sonograms, are created by beaming ultrasonic pulses into the body and measuring the time required\nfor the echoes to return. This technique is commonly used to evaluate heart function (echocardiograms) and\nto visualize the fetus in the uterus, as shown above (left). In shock wave lithotripsy (right), pulses of high-\nfrequency sound waves are used to shatter kidney stones into fragments that can be passed in the urine.\n\nOne final example of infrasound is related to a dramatic event\nthat occurred in southern New Mexico about a decade ago. At\n12:47 in the afternoon of October 10, 1997, a meteor shining\nas bright as the full Moon streaked across the sky for a few\nbrief moments. The event was observed not just visually,\nhowever, but with infrasound as well. An array of special\nmicrophones at the Los Alamos National Laboratory—\noriginally designed to listen for clandestine nuclear weapons\ntests—heard the infrasonic boom created by the meteor.

They emit a\ncontinuous stream of ultrasonic sounds\nand detect the echoes from objects around\nthem. Blue whales, by contrast, communi-\ncate over long distances by means of infra-\nsonic sounds.\n\nIt should be noted, in light of the wide range of frequencies\nobserved in sound, that the speed of sound is the same for all\nfrequencies. Thus, in the relation\n\nthe speed v remains fixed. For example, if the frequency of a\nwave is doubled, its wavelength is halved, so that the speed v\nstays the same. The fact that different frequencies travel with\nthe same speed is evident when we listen to an orchestra in a\nlarge room. Different instruments are producing sounds of\ndifferent frequencies, but we hear the sounds at the same time.\nOtherwise, listening to music from a distance would be quite\na different and inharmonious experience.\n\n248\n",

In\naddition, we are able to hear sounds over a wide range of\nfrequencies, from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.\n\nWhen detecting the faintest of sounds, our hearing is more\nsensitive than one would ever guess. For example, a faint\nsound, with an intensity of about 107! W/m’causes a\ndisplacement of molecules in the air of about 10°!° m. This\ndisplacement is roughly the diameter of an atom!\n\nEqually interesting is the way we perceive the loudness of a\nsound. As an example, suppose you hear a sound of intensity\nI.

One of\nthe more fascinating aspects of the Doppler effect is the fact\nthat it applies to all wave phenomena, not just to sound. In\nparticular, the frequency of light is also Doppler-shifted when\nthere is relative motion between the source and receiver. For\nlight, this change in frequency means a change in color. In fact,\nmost distant galaxies are observed to be red-shifted in the color\nof their light, which means they are moving away from the\nEarth. Some galaxies, however, are moving toward us, and\ntheir light shows a blue shift. In the remainder of this section,\nwe focus on the Doppler effect in sound waves.

See Table 5-3 on for\nsemitones in the vicinity of middle C.\n\nMoving Source\n\nWith a stationary observer and a moving source, the Doppler\neffect is not due to the sound wave appearing to have a higher\nor lower speed, as when the observer moves. On the contrary,\nthe speed of a wave is determined by the properties of the\nmedium through which it propagates. Thus, once the source\nemits a sound wave, it travels through the medium with its\ncharacteristic speed v regardless of what the source is doing.\n\nBy way of analogy, consider a water wave. The speed of such\nwaves is the same whether they are created by a rock dropped\ninto the water or by a stick moved rapidly through the water.\nTo take an extreme case, the waves coming to the beach from\na slow-moving tugboat move with the same speed as the waves\nproduced by a 100-mph speed boat.

In physical terms, recall that a moving\nobserver encounters wave crests separated by the wavelength,\nas indicated in Figure 5—15. Doubling the speed of the\nobserver simply reduces the time required to move from one\ncrest to the next by a factor of 2, which doubles the frequency.\nThus, in general, the frequency is proportional to the speed, as\nwe see in the lower curve in Figure 5—18. In contrast, when the\nsource moves, as in Figure 5—16, the wave crests become\n“bunched up” in the forward direction, since the source is\nalmost keeping up with the propagating waves. As the speed\nof the source approaches the speed of sound, the separation\nbetween crests approaches zero.

For example, the speed of light is about 300 000 000 m/s, and the\nink required to make the dot over an 7 in this textbook has a mass of about\n0.000 000 001 kg. Obviously, it is very cumbersome to read, write, and keep track\nof numbers such as these. We avoid this problem by using a method dealing with\npowers of the number 10:\n\n10° = 1\n\n10! = 10\n\n10? = 10 x 10 = 100\n\n10° = 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000\n\n10* = 10 x 10 X 10 X 10 = 10000\n10° = 10 x 10 X 10 x 10 x 10 = 100 000\n\nand so on. The number of zeros corresponds to the power to which 10 is raised,\ncalled the exponent of 10. For example, the speed of light, 300 000 000 m/s, can\nbe expressed as 3 X 10° m/s.\n\nIn this method, some representative numbers smaller than unity are\n\n1\n\n10-7! = —=0.1\n10\n\n; 1\n\n10-2 = ———-= 0.01\n10 x 10\n\n10°'= ee 0.001\n10 x 10 x 10 :\n\n1\n\n10-4 = —————————_ = 0,000 1\n\n10 x 10 x 10 x 10\n_s 1\n107? = ——_M_——— = 0.000 01\n\n10 X 10 Xx 10 x 10 x 10\n\n283\n",

Numbers expressed as some power of\n10 multiplied by another number between | and 10 are said to be in scientific no-\ntation.
